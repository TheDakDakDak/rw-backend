		<h2>FAQs</h2>
		<details>
			<summary>Why can't I log in and why doesn't anything work?</summary>
			<p>The site is under construction. I'm building it myself and have a lot of work to do.</p>

		<details>
			<summary>What is Rainstorm Weights?</summary>
			<p>A fully functional workout tracking application. You select a lift type and then every time you complete a set, you enter how much weight you lifted and for how many reps. Your daily screen will be a list of the lifts you performed that day with the set information included. It's useful to look at the data from past days and weeks so you can apply progressive overload. In addition to simply storing your workout data, Rainstorm Weights will also provide you with analytics like your 1 rep max and charts to go with it.</p>

			<summary>Why Rainstorm Weights?</summary>
			<p>Despite being fully functional, it's free. Building muscle and staying in shape is hard work enough. I believe that everyone should have access to tools to make this more convenient. A healthy society is a happy and functional society that benefits all of us.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>Why did you make this?</summary>
			<p>A few reasons. I recently earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and I'd like to have a nice project to show potential employers. My mom was using a workout tracker for a while, but it eventually wanted her to subscribe for a monthly fee. So it's been on my mind for a while that I wanted to create a free workout app that anybody can use.</p>

		<details id="detailsLast">
			<summary>When will the site be ready?</summary>
			<p>I don't know. In addition to having a day job, I have two young boys I'm raising, so I'm working on this in my spare time and it's just me building it. That said, I do have a sense of urgency to get it done as I'd like potential employers to be able to see it as quickly as possible.</p>
