		<h2>FAQs</h2>
		<details>
			<summary>What is Rainstorm Weights?</summary>
			<p>Right now, it's simply a workout tracker app. You enter your exercises and every time you do a set, you enter the weight and reps. The website will handle everything else and keep track of your workouts for you. You can see your workouts for any day that you've entered them. Analytics are planned for the future, but for now, all you'll see on your profile page is your total number of workouts, sets, reps, and total amount of weight lifted. The site is under active construction, so new features will be added fairly regularly.</p>

			<summary>What is planned for the future</summary>
			<p>Analytics and recommendations are next. I also plan to set up a friend system where your friends can visit your profile and see how you're doing. Maybe spark some friendly competititon. Once those are done, I'll have no problem thinking of more features to add, but at the same time I will take precautions so that I don't bloat the app.</p>

		<details>
			<summary>Is it free?</summary>
			<p>Yes. I don't have plans to ever monetize it, but I won't write the option off totally. That said, if you already have an account and I someday decide to monetize it, you will be grandfathered in and will never have to pay for features you already use. So you never have to worry about your workout tracking going away or being hidden behind a paywall.</p>

		<details>
			<summary>Why did you make this?</summary>
			<p>A few reasons. I recently earned my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and I'd like to have a nice project to show potential employers. My mom was using a workout tracker for a while, but it eventually wanted her to subscribe for a monthly fee. So it's been on my mind for a while that I wanted to create a free workout app that anybody can use.</p>

		<details id="detailsLast">
			<summary>When will the site be fully complete?</summary>
			<p>Better question is "will it ever be done?". I don't know. I might just keep adding features to it indefinitely. Also, in addition to having a day job, I have two young boys I'm raising, so I'm working on this in my spare time and it's just me building it.</p>
